*How to use OpenReact classes*

To be able to use OpenReact classes, you need to register the OpenReact class 
autoloaders via the OpenReact_Autoload::register() method.

A very simple way (PHP example code):

<?php
require_once '{where you have installed the OpenReact library}/OpenReact/Autoload.php';

React_Autoload::register();
?>

Note: Even if you already have a class-loader which can find OpenReact classes,
you still need to call the OpenReact_Autoload::register() method for initialization 
of the OpenReact exception auto-creation.
